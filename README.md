# Churn-Prediction

The telecommunications industry is made up of cable companies, internet service providers, satellite companies and telephone companies. Telecommunications is defined as communicating over a distance. The industryâ€™s origin can be traced to postal courier services.

Customer churn in the telecom industry poses one of the most significant risks to loss of revenue. The average churn rate in the telecom industry is approx. 1.9% per month across the four major carriers, but could rise as high as 67% annually for prepaid services.

Considering that customer churn in telecom is expensive and inevitable, leveraging to understand the factors that influence customer attrition, identifying customers that are most likely to churn and offering them discounts can be a great way to reduce it.

In our project, we build some models in R to understand the correlation between the different variables in the dataset and customer churn. Then we check the accuracy of those modes to find which model is best. This end-to-end churn prediction model will tweak the problem of dissatisfaction and make the revenue flowing for the telecom company.
